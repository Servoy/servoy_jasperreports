 For more information about Servoy, visit http://www.servoy.com.
 For more information about JasperReports, visit: http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library.
  
 INSTALLATION:
 Unpack the plugins directory in this zipfile into the plugins directory of your Servoy application server.
 
 DEPENDENCIES:
 The JasperReport engine depends on external libraries. 
 See http://community.jaspersoft.com/wiki/jasperreports-library-requirements for more information.
 
 Some of these libraries are included in this package. 
    * Jakarta Commons BeanUtils Component (version 1.7 or later) http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils/
    * Jakarta Commons Javaflow (Sandbox version) http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/javaflow/
    * Jakarta Commons Digester Component (version 1.7 or later) http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/digester/
    * Eclipse JDT Java Compiler (recommended) http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/
    * iText - Free Java-PDF library by Bruno Lowagie and Paulo Soares (version 1.3.1 or later) http://www.lowagie.com/iText/

	Note: An earlier version of the iText library is also shipped with the PDF output plugin of Servoy (located in ../plugins/pdf_output). 
	Remove this to prevent conflicts if both plugins are installed

 Other are part of the default installation of Servoy:
    * Jakarta Commons Collections Component (version 2.1 or later) http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/
    * Jakarta Commons Logging Component (version 1.0 or later) http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/
 
 This build also includes support for charting and Groovy script language.
 
 JASPERSOFT STUDIO:
 As of version 5.5.0, Jaspersoft Studio will be the official design client for JasperReports. See http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jaspersoft-studio
 
 UPGRADING THE JASPERREPORT ENGINE:
 The JasperReports engine can be upgraded separately when a new version of the engine is released. 
 To do so, download the new engine from http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library/resources and place the jasperreports-x.x.x.jar file into the ../plugins/servoy_jasperreports folder and remove the old jar from there.
 Update any other libraries which have changed in the new version of the engine (see the full project libraries for this).
 Also update the reference in the plugins jnlp file (../plugins/servoy_jasperreports.jar.jnlp).
 Do note that this step must be handled with great caution. Please keep libraries in sync between Servoy, JasperReports and the plugin.
